This is to announce another test release of C-Kermit, 4F(082), to replace
the earlier test release 4F(077) that was announced on April 3, 1989.  This
version fixes several serious problems in 4F(077), namely:

  - Connect-mode lockup when when connecting back to a remote system
    after transferring a file.  Thanks to Frank Prindle for finding
    the fix for this.  The fix is only for BSD versions, other versions
    may still experience minor problems (a few glitch characters) under
    these circumstances -- if anybody can track down the problem and
    fix it, please do!

  - Protocol misnegotiations when C-Kermit running in server mode,
    caused by a missing comment delimeter.

  - Hangup command, and ^\h connect-escape, fixed up so as not
    to leave lock files around (Patrick Wolfe).  Seems to work OK
    in BSD-based UNIX versions, untested in System III/V.

Besides these fixes, 4F(080) has several new features, including:

  - Further performance improvements, mostly from Paul Placeway of Ohio
    State University (of Macintosh Kermit fame), including "encode-ahead"
    and dynamic packet sizing.

  - Support for OS/2, contributed by Chris Adie of Edinburgh University
    in Scotland.  Unfortunately, Chris's work was based on release 4E(070)
    of C-Kermit, and so there had to be a lot of code-shuffling.  The result
    is entirely untested, which is one reason why this release is a test
    release rather than a real release.  See the separate announcement from
    Chris Adie.
    
  - A new 'transmit' command, for raw uploading.

  - 'dial' command support for the Microcom ax9624 modem, from Jim Knutson.

  - Support for 4.1BSD, Apple A/UX, and NeXT added to makefile (but not
    tested).

  - Addition of file creation date to the attributes which C-Kermit sends.
    C-Kermit still does not do anything with dates on received files (tested
    in Berkeley versions, not tested in AT&T or other versions).

  - Support for tilde in file names in all interactive commands that parse
    input or output file names (SEND, RECEIVE, GET, DIRECTORY, LOG, CD, etc).

  - Support for tilde in file names sent to the C-Kermit server in GET,
    REMOTE DIRECTORY, and similar commands.

See the file ckuker.upd for details about the changes and contributors.

This release has been compiled and tested on a SUN-4/280 with SUNOS 4.0, a
VAX/8700 with Ultrix 2.0, and an Encore Multimax 310 with UMAX V 2.2.  This
version was also briefly tested in the AT&T System V environment on the SUN,
and seemed to work OK.  Further testing is required on AT&T UNIX variants,
Xenix, etc.

The new release is available via ftp from watsun.cc.columbia.edu, in the
directory kermit/test/ck*.  Also in the same directory on cunixc.

BITNET/EARN users may also access the test files in the new KERMSRV test area.
Refer to these files as T:CKU*.*, T:CKC*.*, T:CKW*.*, and (for OS/2) T:CKO*.*,
for example:

  TELL KERMSRV AT CUVMA MAIL DIR T:*.*
  TELL KERMSRV AT CUVMA SEND T:CKC*.*

Please get the files, try them out, and report any problems to me.  After the
kinks are worked out, version 4F will replace the current standard 4E release.

Note, there are also some ckv*.* files in kermit/test for the VAX/VMS version
of C-Kermit, but they are not totally up-to-date with this new test release.
Watch Info-Kermit for further announcements.

There are also some other C-Kermit systems that haven't been updated in a
long time, including the Amiga (cki*.*), and Data General AOS/VS (ckd*.*).
