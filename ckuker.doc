1. μCKERMIT

μCKermit is an implementation of Kermit, written modularly and transportably in
C. The protocol state transition table is written in wart, a  (non-proprietary)
lex-like  preprocessor for C. System-dependent primitive functions are isolated
into separately compiled modules so that the program should be easily portable.

μCKermit provides traditional UNIX command line operation  as  well  as  inter-
active  command  prompting and execution.  The command line options provide ac-
cess to a basic subset of μCKermit's capabilities; the interactive command  set
is far richer.

On  systems  with  dialout  modems,  μCKermit's command file, DIAL command, and
login script facilities  provide  a  counterpart  to  UUCP  (UNIX-to-UNIX  Copy
Program)  for  file  transfer  with  including  the use of scheduled (e.g. late
night) unattended operation.  UUCP can only be used between computers that sup-
port  UUCP,  but  μCKermit  can  be used to transfer files with the much larger
variety of computers that have Kermit (or even with computers that  don't  have
Kermit, if you use μCKermit's "raw" uploading and downloading features).


1.1. The UNIX File System

Consult  your  UNIX manual for details about the file system under your version
of UNIX.  In general, UNIX files have lowercase names, possibly containing  one
or  more  dots  or  other special characters.  UNIX directories are tree-struc-
tured.  Directory levels are separated by slash ("/") characters.  For example,

    /usr/cmg/bar

denotes the file bar in the directory /usr/cmg.  Alphabetic case is significant
in UNIX file and directory names, i.e. "a" is a different file  (or  directory)
from "A".  Wildcard or "meta" characters allow groups of files to be specified.
"*" matches any string; "?" matches any single  character;  tilde  "~"  at  the
beginning  of  a  file specification matches the user's home directory, or fol-
lowed immediately by another username, that user's home directory.

When μCKermit is invoked with file arguments  specified  on  the  UNIX  command
line, the  UNIX shell (Bourne Shell, C-Shell, Korn Shell, etc) expands the meta
characters itself, and in this case a wider variety may be available.  For  ex-
ample,

    kermit -s ~/ck[uvm]*.{upd,bwr}]

is expanded (by the Berkeley C-Shell) into a list of  all the files in the user
home directory (~/) that start with the characters "ck", followed by  a  single
character  "u", "v", or "m", followed by zero or more characters, followed by a
dot, followed by one of the strings "upd" or "bwr".  Internally,  the  μCKermit
program itself expands only the "~", "*", and "?" meta characters.

UNIX  files are linear (sequential) streams of 8-bit bytes.  Text files consist
streams of ASCII characters (or characters in other codes) with lines separated
by  the UNIX newline character, which is linefeed (LF, ASCII 10).  This distin-
guishes UNIX text files from those on most other ASCII systems, in which  lines
are  separated  by a carriage-return linefeed sequence (CRLF, ASCII 13 followed
by ASCII 10).  Binary files are likely to contain data in the high bits of  the
file bytes, and have no particular line or record structure.

When  transferring  files,  μCKermit  will convert between upper and lower case
filenames and between LF and CRLF line terminators automatically,  unless  told
to  do otherwise.  When binary files must be transferred, the program should be
instructed not to perform LF/CRLF conversion (-i on the command  line  or  "set
file type binary" interactively; see below).


1.2. File Transfer

If  μCKermit  is  in  local mode, the screen (stdout) is continously updated to
show the progress of the file transer.  A dot is printed for  every  four  data
packets, other packets are shown by type:

    I Exchange Parameter Information
    R Receive Initiate
    S Send Initiate
    A Attribute packet
    F File Header
    G Generic Server Command
    C Remote Host Command
    N Negative Acknowledgement (NAK)
    E Fatal Error
    T Indicates a timeout occurred
    Q Indicates a damaged, undesired, or illegal packet was received
    % Indicates a packet was retransmitted

You may type the following "interrupt" commands during file transfer:

    Control-F:  Interrupt the current File, and go on to the next (if any).
    Control-B:  Interrupt the entire Batch of files, terminate the transaction.
    Control-R:  Resend the current packet
    Control-A:  Display a status report for the current transaction.

These  interrupt characters differ from the ones used in other Kermit implemen-
tations to avoid conflict with commonly used UNIX shell  interrupt  characters.
With  Version  7,  System  III, and System V implementations of UNIX, interrupt
commands must be preceeded by the 'connect'  escape  character  (e.g.  normally
Ctrl-\).   Ctrl-F and Ctrl-B are effective only during the transfer of data (D)
packets, and cannot be used to interrupt a transfer that has  not  yet  reached
that stage.

    CAUTION:  If Control-F or Control-B is used to cancel an incoming file,
    and a file of the same name previously existed, and the "file  warning"
    feature  is  not  enabled, then the previous copy of the file will dis-
    appear.

EMERGENCY EXIT:  When running  μCKermit in  remote mode, if you have  started a
protocol operation (sending or receiving a file, server command wait, etc), you
will not be able to communicate with the terminal in the normal way.   In  par-
ticular,  you  cannot  stop  the  protocol  by typing the normal UNIX interrupt
characters, since the terminal has been put in "raw mode".    If  you  need  to
regain  control  quickly  -- for instance, because the protocol is stuck -- you
can type two  Control-C's directly to the  μCKermit  program  ("connect"  first
if necessary):

    Control-C Control-C

This will cause the program to display,

    ^C^C...

exit, and restore the terminal to normal.


1.3. Command Line Operation

The μCKermit command line syntax conforms to the "Proposed Syntax Standards for
UNIX System Commands" put forth by Kathy Hemenway and Helene Armitage  of  AT&T
Bell Laboratories in "UNIX/World", Vol.1, No.3, 1984. The rules that apply are:

   - Command names must be between 2 and 9 characters ("kermit" is 6).
   - Command names must include lower case letters and digits only.
   - An option name is a single character.
   - Options are delimited by '-'.
   - Options  with  no  arguments  may  be  grouped  (bundled)  behind one
     delimiter.
   - Option-arguments cannot be optional.
   - Arguments immediately follow options, separated by whitespace.
   - The order of options does not matter.
   - '-' preceded and followed by whitespace means standard input.

A group of bundled options may end with an option that has an argument.

The following notation is used in command descriptions:

fn      A UNIX file specification, possibly containing the  "wildcard"  charac-
        ters  `*'  or  `?' (`*' matches all character strings, `?'  matches any
        single character).

fn1     A UNIX file specification which may not contain `*' or `?'.

rfn     A remote file specification in the remote system's  own  syntax,  which
        may denote a single file or a group of files.

rfn1    A remote file specification which should denote only a single file.

n       A decimal number between 0 and 94.

c       A  decimal  number between 0 and 127 representing the value of an ASCII
        character.

cc      A decimal number between 0 and 31, or else  exactly  127,  representing
        the value of an ASCII control character.

[ ]     Any field in square braces is optional.

{x,y,z} Alternatives are listed in curly braces.

μCKermit  command  line options may specify any combination of actions and set-
tings.  If μCKermit is invoked with a command line that specifies  no  actions,
then  it  will  issue  a  prompt  and begin interactive dialog.  Action options
specify either protocol transactions or terminal connection.

An implicit 'take' command is executed upon your  .kermrc4 file  when  μCKermit
starts  up,  upon either interactive or command-line invocation.  This file may
contain μCKermit interactive-mode commands, which are explained later.

-s fn   Send the specified file or files.    If  fn  contains  wildcard  (meta)
        characters,  the  UNIX  shell expands it into a list.  fn may also be a
        list of files, as in:

            kermit -s ckcmai.c ckuker.h mail.txt

        If fn is '-' then kermit sends from standard input, which may come from
        a file:

            kermit -s - < foo.bar

        or a parallel process:

            ls -l | grep cmg | kermit -s -

        You  cannot use this mechanism to send terminal typein.  If you want to
        send a file whose actual name is "-" you can precede  it  with  a  path
        name, as in

            kermit -s ./-

-r      Receive a file or files.  Wait passively for files to arrive.

-k      Receive  (passively)  a file or files, sending them to standard output.
        This option can be used in several ways:

        kermit -k
            Displays  the  incoming  files  on  your screen; to be used only in
            "local mode" (see below).

        kermit -k > fn1
            Sends  the  incoming file or files to the named file, fn1.  If more
            than one file arrives,  all  are  concatenated  together  into  the
            single file fn1.

        kermit -k | command
            Pipes the incoming data (single or multiple files) to the indicated
            command, as in

                kermit -k | sort > sorted.stuff

-a fn1  If you have specified a file transfer option, you may give an alternate
        name for a single file with the -a ("as") option.  For example,

            kermit -s foo -a bar

        sends the file foo telling the receiver that its name is bar.  If  more
        than  one  file  arrives or is sent, only the first file is affected by
        the -a option:

            kermit -ra baz

        stores the first incoming file under the name baz.

-x      Begin server operation.  May be used in either local or remote mode.

Before proceeding, a few words about remote and local operation are  necessary.
μCKermit  is  "local"  if it is running on PC or workstation that you are using
directly, or if it is running on a multiuser system and transferring files over
an  external  communication line -- not your job's controlling terminal or con-
sole.  μCKermit is remote if it is running on a multiuser system and  transfer-
ring  files  over  its  own controlling terminal's communication line (normally
/dev/tty), connected to your PC or workstation.

If you are running μCKermit on a PC, it is normally used in  local  mode,  with
the  "back  port" designated for file transfer and terminal connection, and the
keyboard and screen available to control or interrupt the file transfer and  to
display  its  status.  If you are running μCKermit on a multiuser (timesharing)
system, it is in remote mode unless you explicitly point it at an external line
for  file  transfer  or  terminal connection.  The following command determines
whether μCKermit is in local or remote mode:

-l dev  Line -- Specify a terminal line to use for file transfer  and  terminal
        connection, as in

            kermit -l /dev/ttyS5

When an external line is being used, you will also need some additional options
for successful communication with the remote system:

-b n    Baud -- Specify the transmission speed in bits per second ("baud rate")
        for the line given in the -l option, as in:

            kermit -l /dev/ttyS5 -b 9600

        This  option  should  always  be included with the -l option, since the
        speed of an external line is not necessarily what you expect.

-p x    Parity -- e,o,m,s,n (even, odd, mark, space, or none).   If  parity  is
        other than none, then Kermit's 8th bit prefixing mechanism will be used
        for transferring  8-bit  binary  data,  provided  the  opposite  Kermit
        agrees.  The default parity is none.

-t      Specifies  half  duplex,  line  turnaround  with  XON  as the handshake
        character.

The following commands may be used only with a μCKermit which is in local mode.

-g rfn  Actively request a remote server to send the named file or  files;  rfn
        is a file specification in the remote host's own syntax.  If fn happens
        to contain any special shell characters, like  space,  '*',  '[',  '~',
        etc, these must be quoted, as in:

            kermit -g x\*.\?

        or:

            kermit -g "profile exec"

-f      Send a 'finish' command to a remote server.

-c      Establish  a  terminal  connection  over  the specified or default com-
        munication line, before any protocol transaction takes place.  Get back
        to   the   local  system  by  typing  the  escape  character  (normally
        Control-Backslash) followed by the letter 'c'.

-n      Like -c, but after a protocol transaction takes place; -c  and  -n  may
        both  be used in the same command.  The use of -n and -c is illustrated
        below.

If the other Kermit is on a remote system, the -l and -b options should also be
included with the -r, -k, or -s options.

Several other command-line options are provided:

-i      Specifies that files should be sent or received exactly "as is" with no
        conversions.  This option is necessary for transmitting  binary  files.
        It may also be used in UNIX-to-UNIX transfers (it must be given to both
        μCKermit  programs), where  it will  improve performance by circumvent-
        ing  the  normal  text-file conversions, and will allow mixture of text
        and binary files in a single file group.

-w      Write-Protect -- Avoid filename collisions for incoming files.

-e n    Extended packet length -- Specify that μCKermit is allowed  to  receive
        packets  up  to length n, where n may be between 10 and some large num-
        ber, like 1000 or 2000, depending on the system.  The  default  maximum
        length for received packets is 90.  Packets longer than 94 will be used
        only if the other Kermit supports, and agrees to use, the "long packet"
        protocol extension.

-q      Quiet  --  Suppress screen update during file transfer, for instance to
        allow a file transfer to proceed in the background.

-d      Debug -- Record debugging information in the file debug.log in the cur-
        rent  directory.    Use  this option if you believe the program is mis-
        behaving, and show the resulting log to your local Kermit maintainer.

-h      Help -- Display a brief synopsis of the command line options.

The command line may contain no more than one protocol action option.

Files are sent with their own names, except that lowercase letters  are  raised
to upper, pathnames are stripped off, certain special characters like (`~') and
(`#') are changed to `X', and if the file name begins with a period, an `X'  is
inserted  before  it.    Incoming files are stored under their own names except
that uppercase letters are lowered, and, if -w  was  specified,  a  "generation
number"  is  appended  to  the name if it has the same name as an existing file
which would otherwise be overwritten.  If the -a option is included,  then  the
same  rules  apply to its argument.  The file transfer display shows any trans-
formations performed upon filenames.

During transmission, files are encoded as follows:

   - Control characters are converted to prefixed printables.

   - Sequences of repeated characters are collapsed via repeat counts,  if
     the other Kermit is also capable of repeated-character compression.

   - If  parity  is  being used on the communication line, data characters
     with the 8th (parity) bit on are  specially  prefixed,  provided  the
     other  Kermit  is  capable of 8th-bit prefixing; if not, 8-bit binary
     files cannot be successfully transferred.

   - Conversion is done between UNIX newlines and carriage-return-linefeed
     sequences unless the -i option was specified.


Command Line Examples:


    kermit -l /dev/ttyS5 -b 1200 -cn -r

This command connects you to the system on the other end of ttyi5 at 1200 baud,
where you presumably log in and run Kermit with a 'send' command.    After  you
escape  back,  μCKermit  waits  for a file (or files) to arrive.  When the file
transfer is completed, you are reconnected to the remote system so that you can
logout.


    kermit -l /dev/ttyS4 -b 1800 -cntp m -r -a foo

This  command  is like the preceding one, except the remote system in this case
uses half duplex communication with mark parity.  The first file  that  arrives
is stored under the name foo.


    kermit -l /dev/ttyS6 -b 9600 -c | tek

This  example  uses  Kermit to connect your terminal to the system at the other
end of ttyi6.  The μCKermit terminal connection does not provide any particular
terminal   emulation,   so   μCKermit's   standard   i/o  is  piped  through  a
(hypothetical) program called tek, which performs (say) Tektronix emulation.


    kermit -l /dev/ttyS6 -b 9600 -nf

This command would be used to shut down a remote server and then connect to the
remote system, in order to log out or to make further use of it.  The -n option
is invoked after -f (-c would have been invoked before).


    kermit -l /dev/ttyS6 -b 9600 -qg foo.\* &

This command causes μCKermit to be invoked in the background, getting  a  group
of files from a remote server (note the quoting of the `*' character).  No dis-
play occurs on the screen, and the keyboard is  not  sampled  for  interruption
commands.    This  allows other work to be done while file transfers proceed in
the background.


    kermit -l /dev/ttyS6 -b 9600 -g foo.\* > foo.log < /dev/null &

This command is like the previous one, except the  file  transfer  display  has
been  redirected  to  the  file foo.log.  Standard input is also redirected, to
prevent μCKermit from sampling it for interruption commands.


    kermit -iwx

This command starts up μCKermit as a server.  Files  are  transmitted  with  no
newline/carriage-return-linefeed conversion; the -i option is necessary for bi-
nary file transfer and recommended for UNIX-to-UNIX transfers.  Incoming  files
that have the same names as existing files are given new, unique names.


    kermit -l /dev/ttyS6 -b 9600

This  command  sets  the  communication  line  and  speed.   Since no action is
specified, μCKermit issues a prompt and enters an interactive dialog with  you.
Any  settings  given on the command line remain in force during the dialog, un-
less explicitly changed.


    kermit

This command starts up Kermit interactively with all default settings.

The next example shows how μCKermit  might  be  used to send an  entire  direc-
tory  tree  from  one UNIX system to another, using the tar program as Kermit's
standard input and output.  On the orginating system, in this case the  remote,
type (for instance):


    tar cf - /usr/home/fdc | kermit -is -

This  causes  tar  to  send the  directory /usr/home/fdc (and all its files and
all its subdirectories  and  all their files...) to  standard output instead of
to a tape; kermit  receives  this as  standard input  and sends  it as a binary
file. On the receiving system, in this case the local one, type (for instance):


    kermit -il /dev/ttyS5 -b 9600 -k | tar xf -

Kermit receives the tar archive, and sends it via standard output  to  its  own
copy of tar, which extracts from it a replica of the original directory tree.

A  final example shows how a UNIX compression utility might be used to speed up
Kermit file transfers:

    compress file | kermit -is -     (sender)
    kermit -ik | uncompress          (receiver)


Exit Status Codes:

μCKermit  returns an exit  status of  zero, except when a fatal  error  is  en-
countered,  where  the  exit  status  is set to one.  With background operation
(e.g., `&' at end of invoking command line) driven by scripted interactive com-
mands  (redirected  standard  input  and/or take files), any failed interactive
command (such as failed dial or script attempt) causes the fatal error exit.


1.4. Interactive Operation

μCKermit's interactive command prompt is "uCKermit>".    In  response  to  this
prompt, you may type any valid interactive μCKermit command.  μCKermit executes
the command and then prompts you for another command.   The  process  continues
until you instruct the program to terminate.

Commands  begin  with a keyword, normally an English verb, such as "send".  You
may omit trailing characters from any keyword, so  long  as  you  specify  suf-
ficient  characters  to  distinguish  it  from  any other keyword valid in that
field.  Certain commonly-used keywords (such as "send",  "receive",  "connect")
also  have special non-unique abbreviations ("s" for "send", "r" for "receive",
"c" for "connect").

Certain characters have special functions during  typein  of  interactive  com-
mands:

    ?   Question  mark, typed at any point in a command, will produce a message
        explaining what is possible or expected at that point.    Depending  on
        the  context, the message may be a brief phrase, a menu of keywords, or
        a list of files.

    ESC (The Escape or Altmode  key)  --  Request  completion  of  the  current
        keyword  or filename, or insertion of a default value.  The result will
        be a beep if the requested operation fails.

    TAB (The horizontal Tab key) -- Same as ESC.

    DEL (The Delete or Rubout key) -- Delete the previous  character  from  the
        command.  You may also use BS (Backspace, Control-H) for this function.

    ^W  (Control-W) -- Erase the rightmost word from the command line.

    ^U  (Control-U) -- Erase the entire command.

    ^R  (Control-R) -- Redisplay the current command.

    SP  (Space) -- Delimits fields (keywords, filenames, numbers) within a com-
        mand.

    CR  (Carriage Return) -- Enters the command for execution.   LF  (Linefeed)
        or FF (formfeed) may also be used for this purpose.

    \   (Backslash)  --  Enter  any  of  the above characters into the command,
        literally.  To enter a backslash, type two backslashes in a  row  (\\).
        A  backslash  at  the  end of a command line causes the next line to be
        treated as a continuation line; this is useful for readability in  com-
        mand files, especially in the 'script' command.

    ^Z  (Control-Z)  --  On  systems (like Berkeley UNIX, Ultrix) with job con-
        trol, suspend Kermit, i.e. put it into the  background in  such  a  way
        that  it  can  be  brought  back into the foreground (e.g. with an 'fg'
        shell command) with all its settings intact.

You may type the editing characters (DEL, ^W, etc) repeatedly,  to  delete  all
the  way  back to the prompt.  No action will be performed until the command is
entered by typing carriage return, linefeed, or formfeed.  If you make any mis-
takes,  you  will receive an informative error message and a new prompt -- make
liberal use of `?' and ESC to feel your way through the commands.   One  impor-
tant command is "help" -- you should use it the first time you run μCKermit.

A command line beginning with a percent sign "%" is ignored.  Such lines may be
used to include illustrative commentary in Kermit command dialogs.

Interactive μCKermit accepts commands from files as well as from the  keyboard.
When you start μCKermit the program looks for the file .kermrc4 in your home or
current directory (first it looks in the home directory, then  in  the  current
one)  and  executes any commands it finds there.  These commands must be in in-
teractive format, not UNIX command-line format.    A  "take"  command  is  also
provided  for  use  at  any  time  during  an  interactive  session,  to  allow
interactive-format commands to be executed from a file; command  files  may  be
nested to any reasonable depth.

Most of these commands are described adequately in the Kermit User Guide or the
Kermit book.  Special aspects of certain UNIX  Kermit  commands  are  described
below.


                              THE 'SEND' COMMAND

Syntax:  send fn  - or -  send fn1 rfn1

Send  the file or files denoted by fn to the other Kermit, which should be run-
ning as a server, or which should be given the 'receive' command.  Each file is
sent  under  its  own  name  (as  described  above,  or  as  specified  by  the
'set file names' command).  If the second  form of  the 'send' command is used,
i.e.  with  fn1  denoting  a  single  UNIX  file, rfn1  may  be  specified as a
name  to  send  it  under.   For example:

    send sows.ear silk.purse

sends the file sows.ear but tells the other Kermit that its name is silk.purse.

The wildcard (meta) characters `~', `*', and `?' are accepted in fn.  If `?' is
to be included, it must be prefixed by `\' to override its normal  function  of
providing  help.    `~'  is treated as a meta character only if it is the first
character in the file specification.  If it is followed immediately by a slash,
a  space, or end of line, then your login directory name is substituted.  If it
is followed immediately by a username, then that user's login directory name is
substituted.   The `*' character matches any string, and `?' matches any single
character.  Other notations for file groups, like `[a-z]og', are not  available
in  interactive  commands  (though  of course they are available on the command
line).  When fn contains `*' or `?' characters, there is a limit to the  number
of  files  that can be matched, which varies from system to system.  If you get
the message "Too many files match" then you'll have to make  a  more  judicious
selection.  If fn was of the form:

    usr/longname/anotherlongname/*

then  μCKermit's  string space will fill up rapidly -- try using 'cd' to change
your directory to the path in question and reissuing the command.

When μCKermit sends each file, it also sends certain information about the file
in  an "attribute packet", provided the other Kermit agrees to accept attribute
packets.  This information includes the size, type (text or binary,  determined
from  the  "-i"  command-line  option or the "set file type" command), creation
date, and a code to let the other Kermit know that the file is being sent  from
a UNIX system.  The other Kermit may accept or refuse the file based upon these
attributes, for example, if it doesn't have enough disk space to store  a  file
of the specified size.

The  file  type  attribute  allows  μCKermit,  when sending a file, to tell the
receiving whether it should be in text or  binary  mode.    Therefore,  if  the
receiving  Kermit  has  this feature, it is not necessay to give it a "set file
type" command to "match modes" with μCKermit.

Note -- μCKermit sends only from the current or specified directory.   It  does
not traverse directory trees.  If the source directory contains subdirectories,
they will be skipped.  By the same token, μCKermit does not create  directories
when  receiving files.  If you have a need to do this, you can pipe tar through
μCKermit, as shown in the example on page 3, or under System III/V UNIX you can
use cpio.

Another  Note  --  The 'send' command does not skip over "invisible" files that
match the file specification; UNIX systems  usually  treat  files  whose  names
start  with  a dot (like .login, .cshrc, and .kermrc4) as invisible.  Similarly
for "temporary" files whose names start with "#".


                             THE 'RECEIVE' COMMAND

Syntax:  receive  - or -  receive fn1

Passively wait for files to arrive from the other Kermit, which must  be  given
the 'send' command -- the 'receive' command does not work in conjunction with a
server (use 'get' for that).  If fn1 is specified,  store  the  first  incoming
file under that name.

Incoming file data is normally decoded and stored according to whether μCKermit
is in text or binary mode.  But if the other Kermit  sends  the  file-type  at-
tribute,  this  will override μCKermit's file-type setting on a per-file basis.
Therefore, it is possible for another Kermit program to send μCKermit a mixture
of  text and binary files, so long as the type of each file is indicated in the
Attribute packet.


                              THE 'GET' COMMAND:

Syntax:  get rfn

        or: get
                rfn
                fn1

Request a remote Kermit server to send the named file or files.  Since a remote
file  specification  (or  list)  might  contain  spaces, which normally delimit
fields of a μCKermit command, an alternate form of the command is  provided  to
allow  the inbound file to be given a new name: type 'get' alone on a line, and
you will be prompted separately for the remote and local  file  specifications,
for example:

    uCKermit>get
     Remote file specification: profile exec
     Local name to store it under: profile.exec

If a `?' is to be included in the remote file specification, you must prefix it
with `\' to suppress its normal function of providing help.

If you have started a multiline 'get' command, you may escape from  its  lower-
level prompts by typing a carriage return in response to the prompt, e.g.

    uCKermit>get
     Remote file specification: foo
     Local name to store it under: (Type a carriage return here)
    (cancelled)
    uCKermit>

After the 'get' command has been entered, the file transfer proceeds exactly as
if you had given a 'send' command to the other Kermit and a  'receive'  command
to this one.


                             THE 'SERVER' COMMAND:

The 'server' command places μCKermit in "server mode" on the currently selected
communication line.  All further commands must arrive as valid  Kermit  packets
from  the  Kermit  on  the  other  end  of the line.  The  μCKermit server  can
respond to the following commands:

Client Command         Server Response
  get                    Sends files
  send                   Receives files
  mail                   Sends incoming files as e-mail to specified address
  bye                    Attempts to log itself out
  finish                 Exits to level from which it was invoked
  remote directory       Sends directory lising
  remote delete          Removes files
  remote cwd             Changes working directory (also, remote cd)
  remote type            Sends files to your screen
  remote print           Receives a file and prints it
  remote space           Reports about its disk usage
  remote who             Shows who's logged in
  remote host            Executes a UNIX shell command
  remote help            Lists these capabilities

The  μCKermit server  cannot  always respond  properly  to a  BYE  command.  It
will  attempt to do so using "kill()", but this will not work on all systems or
under all conditions because of the complicated process structures that can  be
set up under UNIX.

If  the  Kermit  server  is  directed at an external line (i.e. it is in "local
mode") then the console may be used for other work if you have 'set  file  dis-
play  off'; normally the program expects the console to be used to observe file
transfers and enter status queries or interruption commands.  The  way  to  get
μCKermit  into  background operation from interactive command level varies from
system to system (e.g. on Berkeley UNIX you would halt the program with ^Z  and
then  use the C-Shell 'bg' command to continue it in the background).  The more
common method is to invoke the program with the desired command line arguments,
including "-q", and with a terminating "&".

When  the  UNIX  Kermit server is given a 'remote host' command, it executes it
using the shell invoked upon login, e.g. the Bourne shell, the K-Shell, or  the
Berkeley C-Shell.


                  THE 'REMOTE', 'BYE', AND 'FINISH' COMMANDS:

μCKermit  may itself request services from a remote Kermit server.  In addition
to 'send' and 'get', the following commands may also be sent from μCKermit to a
Kermit server:

    remote cwd [directory]
        If the optional remote directory specification is included, you will be
        prompted  on a separate line for a password, which will not echo as you
        type it.  If the remote system does not require  a  password  for  this
        operation,  just  type a carriage return.  'remote cd' is a synomym for
        this command.

    remote delete rfn       delete remote file or files.
    remote directory [rfn]  directory listing of remote files.
    remote host command     command in remote host's own command language.
    remote space            disk usage report from remote host.
    remote type [rfn]       display remote file or files on the screen.
    remote who [user]       display information about who's logged in.
    remote help             display remote server's capabilities.

    bye and finish:
        When  connected  to  a  remote  Kermit server, these commands cause the
        remote server to terminate; 'finish' returns it  to  Kermit  or  system
        command  level  (depending on the implementation or how the program was
        invoked); 'bye' also requests it to log itself out.


                        THE 'LOG' AND 'CLOSE' COMMANDS:

Syntax: log {debugging, packets, session, transactions} [ fn1 ]

μCKermit's progress may be logged in various ways.  The 'log' command  opens  a
log,  the  'close' command closes it.  In addition, all open logs are closed by
the 'exit' and 'quit' commands.  A name may be specified for a log file; if the
name is omitted, the file is created with a default name as shown below.

log debugging
    This produces a voluminous log of the internal workings of μCKermit, of use
    to  Kermit developers or maintainers in tracking down suspected bugs in the
    μCKermit program.  Use of this feature dramatically slows down  the  Kermit
    protocol.  Default name: debug.log.

log packets
    This produces a record of all the packets that go in and out  of  the  com-
    munication port.  This log is of use to Kermit maintainers who are tracking
    down protocol problems in either μCKermit or any Kermit  that  μCKermit  is
    connected to.  Default name:  packet.log.

log session
    This log will contain a copy of everything you see on  your  screen  during
    the  'connect' command, except for local messages or interaction with local
    escape commands.  Default name:  session.log.

log transactions
    The transaction log is a record of all the files that were sent or received
    while transaction logging was in effect.    It  includes  time  stamps  and
    statistics,  filename  transformations,  and records of any errors that may
    have occurred.  The transaction log allows you to have long unattended file
    transfer  sessions  without  fear  of  missing  some  vital screen message.
    Default name:  transact.log.

The 'close' command explicitly closes a log, e.g. 'close debug'.

Note:  Debug and Transaction logs are a compile-time option;  μCKermit  may  be
compiled  without these logs, in which case it will run faster, it will take up
less space on the disk, but the commands relating to them will not be present.


                        LOCAL FILE MANAGEMENT COMMANDS:

μCKermit  allows  some degree  of local file management from  interactive  com-
mand level:

directory [fn]
    Displays a listing of the names, modes, sizes, and dates of files  matching
    fn (which defaults to `*').  Equivalent to `ls -l'.

cwd [directory-name]
    Changes Kermit's working directory to the one  given,  or  to  the  default
    directory  if the directory name is omitted.  This command affects only the
    Kermit process and any processes it may subsequently create.  You may  also
    type "cd" instead of "cwd".

space
    Display information about disk space and/or quota in the current  directory
    and device.

! [command]
    The command is executed by the UNIX shell.  If  no  command  is  specified,
    then  an  interactive  shell  is  started;  exiting from the shell, e.g. by
    typing Control-D or 'exit', will return you to μCKermit command level.  Use
    the  `!'  command  to  provide  file  management or other functions not ex-
    plicitly provided by μCKermit  commands.    The  `!'  command  has  certain
    peculiarities:

       - μCKermit attempts to use your preferred, customary (login) shell.
       - At least one space must separate the '!' from the shell command.
       - A  'cd'  (change  directory) command executed in this manner will
         have no effect -- use the μCKermit 'cwd' command instead.


                        THE 'SET' AND 'SHOW' COMMANDS:

Since Kermit is designed to allow diverse systems to communicate, it  is  often
necessary  to  issue  special  instructions  to  allow  the program to adapt to
peculiarities of another system or the communication path.  These  instructions
are  accomplished by the 'set' command.  The 'show' command may be used to dis-
play current settings.  Here is a brief synopsis of settings available  in  the
current release of μCKermit:

attributes {on, off}
    Tells μCKermit whether to exchange file attribute (A) packets.  Normally it
    will do this if the other Kermit supports this option.  However, to prevent
    any misunderstandings that may arise (e.g. the other Kermit is  refusing  a
    file  because  it thinks there's not enough disk space, but there really is
    enough disk space), you may 'set attributes off' to inhibit this  behavior.
    μCKermit  currently  sends  system  ID, file type, file size, file creation
    date, and encoding attributes.  It honors acceptance and refusal of files.

block-check {1, 2, 3}
    Determines  the  level  of  per-packet  error  detection.  "1" is a single-
    character 6-bit checksum, folded to include the values  of  all  bits  from
    each  character.    "2"  is  a  2-character,  12-bit  checksum.    "3" is a
    3-character, 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC).  The  higher  the  block
    check,  the  better  the  error detection and correction and the higher the
    resulting overhead.  Type 1 is most commonly used; it is supported  by  all
    Kermit  implementations,  and it has proven adequate in most circumstances.
    Types 2 or 3 should be used when transferring 8-bit binary files over noisy
    lines, or when using long packets.

delay n
    How many seconds to wait before sending the first  packet  after  a  'send'
    command.  Used in remote mode to give you time to escape back to your local
    Kermit and issue a 'receive' command before the  first  Kermit  packet  ap-
    pears.  Normally 5 seconds.

duplex {full, half}
    For use during 'connect'.  Specifies  which  side  is  doing  the  echoing;
    'full'  means  the  other  side,  'half'  means  μCKermit  must  echo  your
    keystrokes itself.  Normally full.  Use half when  communicating  with  IBM
    mainframes  over  linemode  connections, and on similar half-duplex connec-
    tions.

escape-character cc
    For use during 'connect' to get μCKermit's attention.  The escape character
    acts as a prefix to an 'escape command', for instance to close the  connec-
    tion  and  return  to  μCKermit  or  UNIX command level.  The normal escape
    character is Control-Backslash (ASCII 28).  The escape  character  is  also
    used  in  System  III/V implementations to prefix interrupt commands during
    file transfers.

file {display, names, type, warning}
    Establish various file-related parameters:

    display {on, off}
        Normally 'on'; when in local mode, display progress of  file  transfers
        on  the  screen (stdout), and listen to the keyboard (stdin) for inter-
        ruptions.  If off (-q on command line) none of this is  done,  and  the
        file transfer may proceed in the background oblivious to any other work
        concurrently done at the console terminal.

    names {converted, literal}
        Normally  converted,  which  means  that  outbound  filenames have path
        specifications stripped, lowercase letters raised to upper, tildes  and
        extra  periods  changed  to X's, and an X inserted in front of any name
        that starts  with  period.    Incoming  files  have  uppercase  letters
        lowered.  Literal means that none of these conversions are done; there-
        fore, any directory path appearing in  a  received  file  specification
        must exist and be write-accessible.  When literal naming is being used,
        the sender should not use path names in the file  specification  unless
        the same path exists on the target system and is writable.

    type {binary, text} [{7, 8}]
        The file type is normally text, which means that conversion is done be-
        tween  UNIX  newline  characters  and  the carriage-return/linefeed se-
        quences required by the canonical Kermit file transmission format,  and
        in  common use on non-UNIX systems.  Binary means to transmit file con-
        tents without conversion.  Binary (`-i' in command  line  notation)  is
        necessary  for  binary  files, and desirable in all UNIX-to-UNIX trans-
        actions to cut down on overhead.

        The optional trailing parameter tells the bytesize for  file  transfer.
        It  is  8  by  default.    If you specify 7, the high order bit will be
        stripped from each byte of sent and received files.  This is useful for
        transferring text files that may have extraneous high order bits set in
        their disk representation (e.g.  Wordstar  or  similar  word  processor
        files).

    warning {on, off}
        Normally off, which means that incoming files will  silently  overwrite
        existing files of the same name.  When on (`-w' on command line) Kermit
        will check if an arriving file would overwrite an existing file; if so,
        it  will construct a new name for the arriving file, of the form foo~n,
        where foo is the name they share and n is a "generation number"; if foo
        exists,  then  the new file will be called foo~1.  If foo and foo~1 ex-
        ist, the new file will be foo~2, and so on.  If the new name  would  be
        longer than the maximum length for a filename, then characters would be
        deleted from the end first, for instance, thelongestname  on  a  system
        with a limit of 14 characters would become thelongestn~1.

            CAUTION:  If Control-F or Control-B is used to cancel an incom-
            ing file, and a file of the same name previously  existed,  and
            the  "file  warning"  feature is not enabled, then the previous
            copy of the file will disappear.

flow-control {none, xon/xoff}
    Normally xon/xoff for full duplex flow control.  Should be set to 'none' if
    the other system cannot do xon/xoff flow control, or if you have  issued  a
    'set  handshake' command.  If set to xon/xoff, then handshake should be set
    to none.  This setting applies during both  terminal  connection  and  file
    transfer.    Warning:  This command may have no effect on certain UNIX sys-
    tems, where Kermit puts the communication line into 'rawmode', and  rawmode
    precludes flow control.

incomplete {discard, keep}
    Disposition for incompletely received files.  If an incoming file is inter-
    rupted  or  an  error occurs during transfer, the part that was received so
    far is normally discarded.  If you "set incomplete  keep"  then  such  file
    fragments will be kept.

handshake {xon, xoff, cr, lf, bell, esc, none}
    Normally none.  Otherwise, half-duplex communication line turnaround  hand-
    shaking  is  done, which means μCKermit  will  not  reply to a packet until
    it has received the indicated handshake character or has timed out  waiting
    for  it;  the  handshake setting applies only during file transfer.  If you
    set handshake to other than none, then flow should be set to none.

line [device-name]
    The device name for the communication line to be used for file transfer and
    terminal connection, e.g. /dev/ttyS3.  If you specify a device name, Kermit
    will be in local mode, and you should remember to issue any other necessary
    'set' commands, such as 'set speed'.  If you omit the device  name,  Kermit
    will  revert  to  its  default mode of operation.  If you specify /dev/tty,
    Kermit will enter remote mode (useful when  logged  in  through  the  "back
    port"  of  a  system normally used as a local-mode workstation).  When UNIX
    Kermit enters local mode, it attempts to synchronize  with  other  programs
    (like  uucp)  that  use  external  communication lines so as to prevent two
    programs using the same  line  at  once;  before  attempting  to  lock  the
    specified  line,  it  will  close  and  unlock  any  external line that was
    previously in use.  The method used for locking is the  "uucp  lock  file",
    explained in more detail later.

modem-dialer {direct, hayes, racalvadic, ventel, ...}
    The type of modem  dialer on the communication line.    "Direct"  indicates
    either  there  is  no  dialout  modem, or that if the line requires carrier
    detection to open, then 'set line' will hang waiting for an incoming  call.
    "Hayes",  "Ventel",  and  the  others  indicate  that 'set line' (or the -l
    argument) will prepare for  a  subsequent  'dial'  command  for  the  given
    dialer.    Support for new dialers is added from time to time, so type 'set
    modem ?' for a list of those supported in your copy of Kermit.    Also  see
    the  description of the 'dial' command.  NOTE: the "set modem" command must
    be given before the "set line" command.

parity {even, odd, mark, space, none}
    Specify  character  parity for use in packets and terminal connection, nor-
    mally none.  If other than none, μCKermit will  seek  to  use  the  8th-bit
    prefixing  mechanism  for transferring 8-bit binary data, which can be used
    successfully only if the other Kermit agrees; if  not,  8-bit  binary  data
    cannot be successfully transferred.

prompt [string]
    The given string will be substituted  for  "uCKermit>"  as  this  program's
    prompt.    If the string is omitted, the prompt will revert to "uCKermit>".
    If the string is enclosed in doublequotes, the quotes will be stripped  and
    any leading and trailing blanks will be retained.

send parameter
    Establish parameters to use when sending packets.  These will be in  effect
    only for the initial packet sent, since the other Kermit may override these
    parameters during the protocol parameter exchange (unless noted below).

    end-of-packet cc
        Specifies the control character needed by the other Kermit to recognize
        the end of a packet.  μCKermit sends this character at the end of  each
        packet.    Normally  13  (carriage return), which most Kermit implemen-
        tations require.  Other Kermits require no  terminator  at  all,  still
        others may require a different terminator, like linefeed (10).

    packet-length n
        Specify the maximum packet length to  send.    Normally  90.    Shorter
        packet  lengths  can be useful on noisy lines, or with systems or front
        ends or networks that have small buffers.  The shorter the packet,  the
        higher  the  overhead,  but the lower the chance of a packet being cor-
        rupted by noise, and the less time  to  retransmit  corrupted  packets.
        This  command  overrides the value requested by the other Kermit during
        protocol initiation unless the other Kermit requests a shorter length.

    pad-character cc
        Designate  a  character  to send before each packet.  Normally, none is
        sent.  Outbound padding is sometimes necessary for  communicating  with
        slow half duplex systems that provide no other means of line turnaround
        control.  It can also be used to send special characters to  communica-
        tions  equipment  that  needs  to  be put in "transparent" or "no echo"
        mode, when this can be accomplished in by feeding it a certain  control
        character.

    padding n
        How many pad characters to send, normally 0.

    start-of-packet cc
        The  normal Kermit packet prefix is Control-A (1); this command changes
        the prefix μCKermit puts on outbound packets.  The  only  reasons  this
        should  ever be changed would be: Some piece of equipment somewhere be-
        tween the two Kermit programs will not pass through  a  Control-A;  or,
        some  piece  of of equipment similarly placed is echoing its input.  In
        the latter case, the recipient of such an echo can  change  the  packet
        prefix for outbound packets to be different from that of arriving pack-
        ets, so that the echoed packets will be ignored.  The  opposite  Kermit
        must also be told to change the prefix for its inbound packets.

    timeout n
        Specifies the number of seconds you want the other Kermit to wait for a
        packet before timing it out and requesting retransmission.

receive parameter
    Establish parameters to request the other Kermit to use when sending  pack-
    ets.

    end-of-packet cc
        Requests the other Kermit to terminate its packets with  the  specified
        character.

    packet-length n
        Specify the maximum packet length to that you want the other Kermit  to
        send,  normally  90.  If you specify a length of 95 or greater, then it
        will be used if the other Kermit supports, and agrees to use, the  Ker-
        mit  protocol  extension  for  long packets.  In this case, the maximum
        length depends upon the systems involved, but there would  normally  be
        no  reason for packets to be more than about 1000 characters in length.
        The 'show parameters' command displays μCKermit's current  and  maximum
        packet lengths.

    pad-character cc
        μCKermit normally does not need to have incoming packets preceded  with
        pad characters.  This command allows μCKermit to request the other Ker-
        mit to use cc as a pad character.  Default cc is NUL, ASCII 0.

    padding n
        How many pad characters to ask for, normally 0.

    start-of-packet cc
        Change the prefix μCKermit looks for on inbound packets  to  correspond
        with what the other Kermit is sending.

    timeout n
        Normally, each Kermit partner sets its packet timeout interval based on
        what the opposite Kermit requests.  This command allows you to override
        the normal procedure  and  specify a timeout interval  for μCKermit  to
        use  when waiting for packets from the other Kermit.  If you specify 0,
        then no timeouts  will  occur, and μCKermit will  wait forever for  ex-
        pected packets to arrive.

server timeout n
    Specify the time interval n in seconds for the μCKermit server to send  NAK
    packets  while  waiting  for  a command packet.  These NAKs are intended to
    break deadlocks in case a client Kermit that cannot time out sends  a  com-
    mand  packet  which is lost.  However, the server command-wait NAKs can in-
    terfere with originate/answer devices that are to be  used  for  answering.
    For  example,  you  can run a μCKermit server on a modem line that normally
    dials out, so that people can dial in  to  it  and  give  Kermit  commands.
    While  waiting  for the phone call to come, the server NAKs might "wake up"
    the modem and put it into originate mode, preventing the incoming call from
    being answered.

speed {0, 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200}
    The transmission speed in bits per second ("baud rate")  for  the  external
    communication  line.    This  command cannot be used to change the speed of
    your own console terminal.  Many UNIX systems are set up in such a way that
    you  must  give  this command after a 'set line' command before you can use
    the line.  'set baud' is a synomym for 'set speed'.  Use 19200 with caution
    -- it may not work on all systems.

terminal
    Used for specifying terminal parameters.  Currently, 'bytesize' is the only
    parameter  provided, and it can be set to 7 or 8.  It's 7 by default, which
    means that the high-order (8th) bit is stripped from each incoming and out-
    going character.


                              THE 'SHOW' COMMAND:

Syntax: show {parameters, versions}

The  "show"  command  with  the  default  argument of "parameters" displays the
values of all the  'set'  parameters  described  above.    If  you  type  "show
versions",  then μCKermit will display the version numbers and dates of all its
internal modules.  You should use the "show versions" command to ascertain  the
vintage of your Kermit program before reporting problems to Kermit maintainers.


                           THE 'STATISTICS' COMMAND:

The  statistics  command  displays  information  about  the  most recent Kermit
protocol transaction, including file and communication line i/o, timing and ef-
ficiency,  as  well  as  what  encoding options were in effect (such as 8th-bit
prefixing, repeat-count compression).


                        THE 'TAKE' AND 'ECHO' COMMANDS:

Syntax: take fn1
     echo [text to be echoed]

The 'take' command instructs μCKermit to execute commands from the named  file.
The  file may contain any interactive μCKermit commands, including 'take'; com-
mand files may be nested to any reasonable depth, but it may not  contain  text
to  be sent to a remote system during the 'connect' command.  This means that a
command file like this:

    set line /dev/tty17
    set speed 9600
    connect
    login myuserid
    mypassword
    etc

will not send "login myserid" or any of the following text to the  remote  sys-
tem.  To carry on a canned dialog, use the 'script' command, described later.

The '%' command is useful for including comments in take-command files.  It may
only be used at the beginning of a line.

The 'echo' command may be used within command files  to  issue  greetings,  an-
nounce progress, ring the terminal bell, etc.  The 'echo' command should not be
confused with the UNIX 'echo' command, which can  be  used  to  show  how  meta
characters would be expanded.  The Kermit echo command simply displays its text
argument (almost) literally at the terminal; the argument may contain octal es-
capes  of the form "\ooo", where o is an octal digit (0-7), and there may be 1,
2, or 3 such digits, whose value specifies an ASCII character, such  as  "\007"
(or "\07" or just "\7") for beep, "\012" for newline, etc.  Each backslash must
be must be entered twice in order for it to be passed along to the echo command
by the Kermit command parser.

Take-command  files  are  in  exactly  the same syntax as interactive commands.
Note that this implies that if you want  to  include  special  characters  like
question  mark  or  backslash  that you would have to quote with backslash when
typing interactive commands, you must quote these characters the  same  way  in
command  files.  Long lines may be continued by ending them with a single back-
slash.

Command files may be used in lieu of command macros, which have  not  been  im-
plemented  in  this version of μCKermit.  For instance, if you commonly connect
to a system called 'B' that is connected to  ttyh7  at  4800  baud,  you  could
create a file called b containing the commands

    % μCKermit command file to connect to System B thru /dev/ttyh7
    set line /dev/ttyh7
    set speed 4800
    % Beep and give message
    echo \\007Connecting to System B...
    connect

and  then simply type 'take b' (or 't b' since no other commands begin with the
letter 't') whenever you wish to connect to system B. Note  the  comment  lines
and the beep inserted into the 'echo' command.

For  linemode connections to IBM mainframes, a number of 'set' commands are re-
quired; these, too, can be conveniently collected into a 'take' file like  this
one:

    % Sample μCKermit command file to set up current line
    % for IBM mainframe communication
    %
    set parity mark
    set handshake xon
    set flow-control none
    set duplex half

Note  that no single command is available to wipe out all of these settings and
return μCKermit to its default startup state; to do that, you can  either  res-
tart the program, or else make a command file that executes the necessary 'set'
commands:

    % Sample μCKermit command file to restore normal settings
    %
    set parity none
    set handshake none
    set flow-control xon/xoff
    set duplex full

An implicit 'take' command is executed upon your .kermrc4  file  when  μCKermit
starts  up,  upon either  interactive or command-line invocation.  The .kermrc4
file should contain 'set' or other commands you want to be  in  effect  at  all
times.   For instance, you might want override the default action when incoming
files have the same names as existing files -- in that case, put the command

    set file warning on

in your .kermrc4 file.  On some non-UNIX systems  that run  μCKermit,  the  in-
itialization   file  might  have  a  different  name,  such  as  kermit.ini  or
ckermit.ini.

Errors encountered during execution of take files (such as failure to  complete
dial  or script operations) cause termination of the current take file, popping
to the level that invoked it (take file,  interactive  level,  or  the  shell).
When  kermit  is  executed in the background, errors during execution of a take
file are fatal.

Under UNIX, you may  also  use  the  shell's  redirection  mechanism  to  cause
μCKermit to execute commands from a file:

    kermit < cmdfile

or you can even pipe commands in from another process:

    command | kermit


                            THE 'CONNECT' COMMAND:

The  'connect'  command  ('c'  is  an  acceptable  non-unique  abbreviation for
'connect') links your terminal to another computer as if it were a  local  ter-
minal  to  that  computer, through the device specified in the most recent 'set
line' command, or through the default device if your system is a PC or worksta-
tion.   All characters you type at your keyboard are sent out the communication
line (and if you have 'set duplex half', also displayed on  your  screen),  and
all  characters arriving at the communication port are displayed on the screen.
Current settings of speed, parity, duplex, and flow-control  are  honored,  and
the  data connection is 7 bits wide unless you have given the command 'set ter-
minal bytesize 8'.  If you have issued a 'log session' command, everything  you
see  on your screen will also be recorded to your session log.  This provides a
way to "capture" files from remote systems  that  don't  have  Kermit  programs
available.

To  get  back  to your own system, you must type the escape character, which is
Control-Backslash (^\) unless you have changed it with the  'set  escape'  com-
mand,   followed  by  a  single-character  command,  such  as  'c'  for  "close
connection".  Single-character commands include:

  c     Close the connection
  b     Send a BREAK signal
  0     (zero) send a null
  s     Give a status report about the connection
  h     Hangup the phone
  ^\    Send Control-Backslash itself (whatever you  have  defined  the  escape
        character to be, typed twice in a row sends one copy of it).

Uppercase  and  control  equivalents  for  (most of) these letters are also ac-
cepted.  A space typed after the  escape  character  is  ignored.    Any  other
character will produce a beep.

The  connect  command simply displays incoming characters on the screen.  It is
assumed any screen control sequences sent by the host will be  handled  by  the
firmware  or  emulation  software  in your terminal or PC.  If special terminal
emulation is desired, then the 'connect' command can invoked from the UNIX com-
mand line (-c or -n), piped through a terminal emulation filter, e.g.

    kermit -l /dev/acu -b 1200 -c | tek


                             THE 'HANGUP' COMMAND:

The 'hangup' command attempts to hang up the modem on a local-mode dialout con-
nection.


                              THE 'DIAL' COMMAND:

Syntax: dial telephone-number-string

This command controls dialout modems; you should have  already  issued  a  "set
line"  and  "set  speed"  command  to  identify the terminal device, and a "set
modem" command to identify the type of modem to be used for dialing.    In  the
"dial"  command, you supply the phone number and the Kermit program feeds it to
the modem in the appropriate format and then interprets dialer return codes and
modem  signals  to  inform  you whether the call was completed.  The telephone-
number-string may contain imbedded modem-dialer commands,  such  as  comma  for
Hayes  pause, or `&' for Ventel dialtone wait and `%' for Ventel pause (consult
your modem manual for details).

At the time of this writing, support is included for the following modems:

   - AT&T 7300 Internal Modem
   - Cermetek Info-Mate 212A
   - Concord Condor CDS 220
   - DEC DF03-AC
   - DEC DF100 Series
   - DEC DF200 Series
   - General DataComm 212A/ED
   - Hayes Smartmodem and compatibles
   - Microcom AX-9624
   - Penril
   - Racal Vadic
   - Rolm CBX
   - US Robotics 212A
   - Ventel
Support for new modems is added to the program from time to time; you can check
the current list by typing "set modem ?".

There  are also two "generic" modem types -- "direct" (i.e. no modem at all, so
that no attempt is made to deal with modem signals), and "unknown" (which tells
μCKermit  to  attempt  to honor modem signals, but leaves the dialing mechanism
unspecified).

The device used for dialing out is the one selected in  the  most  recent  "set
line"  command  (or on a workstation, the default line if no "set line" command
was given).  The "dial" command calls attempts to lock  the  terminal  device's
path  (see the section on line locking below) and to establish a call on an ex-
clusive basis.  If it is desired to dial a call and then return  to  the  shell
(such  as to do kermit activities depending on standard in/out redirection), it
is necessary to place the dialed call under one device name (say,  "/dev/cua0")
and then escape to the shell within Kermit on a linked device which is separate
from the dialed line (say, "/dev/cul0").  This is the same  technique  used  by
uucp (to allow locks to be placed separately for dialing and conversing).

Because  modem  dialers have strict requirements to override the carrier-detect
signal most UNIX implementations expect, the sequence for dialing is more rigid
than most other μCKermit procedures.

Example one:

    kermit -l /dev/cul0 -b 1200
    uCKermit>set modem-dialer hayes    hint: abbreviate set m h
    uCKermit>dial 9,5551212
    Connected!
    uCKermit>connect                   hint: abbreviate c
    logon, request remote server, etc.
    ^\c                                escape back
    uCKermit> ...
    uCKermit>quit                      hint: abbreviate q

this disconnects modem, and unlocks line.

Example two:

    kermit
    uCKermit>set modem-dialer ventel
    uCKermit>set line /dev/cul0
    uCKermit>dial 9&5551212%
    Connected!
    uCKermit> ...

Example three:

    kermit
    uCKermit>take my-dial-procedure
    Connected!

    file my-dial-procedure:
    set modem hayes
    set line /dev/tty99
    dial 5551212
    connect

In  general, μCKermit requires that the modem provide the "carrier detect" (CD)
signal when a call is in progress, and remove that signal when  the  call  com-
pletes  or the line drops.  If a modem switch setting is available to force CD,
it should normally not be in that setting.  μCKermit  also  requires  (on  most
systems)  that  the modem track the computer's "data terminal ready" (DTR) sig-
nal.  If a switch setting is available to  simulate  DTR  asserted  within  the
modem,  then  it  should  normally not be in that setting.  Otherwise the modem
will be unable to hang up at the end of a call or when interrupts are  received
by Kermit.

For  Hayes  1200  dialers, two important switch settings are #1 and #6.  Switch
#1 should be normally be UP so  that  the  modem  can  act  according  to  your
computer's  DTR  signal.  But if your computer, or particular implementation of
Kermit, cannot control DTR, then switch 1 should be DOWN.    Switch  #6  should
normally  be  UP  so  carrier-detect functions properly (but put it DOWN if you
have trouble with the UP position).  Switches #2 (English versus  digit  result
codes)  and  #4 (Hayes echoes modem commands) may be in either position.  Hayes
2400 modems have equivalent "software" switches.

If you want to interrupt a dial command in progress (for instance, because  you
just  realize  that you gave it the wrong number), type a Control-C to get back
to command level.


                             THE 'SCRIPT' COMMAND:

Syntax: script expect send [expect send] . . .

"expect" has the syntax: expect[-send-expect[-send-expect[...]]]

The 'script' command carries on a "canned dialog"  with  a  remote  system,  in
which data is sent according to the remote system's responses.  The typical use
is for logging in to a remote system automatically.

μCKermit's script facility operates in a manner similar to that  commonly  used
by  the  UNIX UUCP system's "L.sys" file entries.  A login script is a sequence
of the form:

    expect send [expect send] . . .

where expect is a prompt or message to be issued by the remote site,  and  send
is  the  string (names, numbers, etc) to return, and expects are separated from
sends by spaces.  The send may also be the keyword EOT, to send  Control-D,  or
BREAK, to send a break signal.  Letters in sends may be prefixed by `~' to send
special characters, including:

    ~b  backspace
    ~s  space
    ~q  `?'(trapped by Kermit's command interpreter)
    ~n  linefeed
    ~r  carriage return
    ~t  tab
    ~'  single quote
    ~~  tilde
    ~"  double quote
    ~x  XON (Control-Q)
    ~c  don't append a carriage return
    ~o[o[o]]  an octal character
    ~d  delay approx 1/3 second during send
    ~w[d[d]]  wait specified interval during expect, then time out

As with some UUCP systems, sent strings are followed by ~r unless they  have  a
~c.

Only  the last 7 characters in each expect are matched.  A null expect, e.g. ~0
or two adjacent dashes, causes a short delay before proceeding to the next send
sequence.  A null expect always succeeds.

As  with  UUCP, if the expect string does not arrive, the script attempt fails.
If you expect that a sequence might not arrive, as with UUCP,  conditional  se-
quences may be expressed in the form:

    -send-expect[-send-expect[...]]

where dashed sequences are followed as long as previous expects fail.  Timeouts
for expects can be specified using ~w; ~w with no arguments waits 15 seconds.

expect-send transactions can be easily be  debugged  by  logging  transactions.
This  records  all  exchanges,  both expected and actual.  The script execution
will also be logged in the session log, if that is activated.

Note that `\' characters in login scripts, as in any other μCKermit interactive
commands,  must  be doubled up.  A line may be ended with a single `\' for con-
tinuation.

Example one:

Using a modem, dial a UNIX host site.   Expect  "login"  (...gin),  and  if  it
doesn't come, simply send a null string with a ~r.  (Some UNIXes require either
an EOT or a BREAK instead of the null sequence,  depending  on  the  particular
site's "logger" program.)  After providing user id and password, respond "x" to
a question-mark prompt, expect the Bourne shell "$" prompt (and send return  if
it  doesn't  arrive).   Then cd to directory kermit, and run the program called
"wermit", entering the interactive connect state after wermit is loaded.

    set modem ventel
    set line /dev/tty77
    set baud 1200
    dial 9&5551212
    script gin:--gin:--gin: smith ssword: mysecret ~q x $--$ \
     cd~skermit $ wermit
    connect

Note that 'set line' is issued after 'set modem',  but  before  'set  baud'  or
other line-related parameters.

Example two:

Using  a  modem,  dial the Telenet network.  This network expects three returns
with slight delays between them.  These are sent following null expects.    The
single return is here sent as a null string, with a return appended by default.
Four returns are sent to be safe before looking  for  the  prompt.    Then  the
Telenet  id and password are entered.  Then Telenet is instructed to connect to
a host site (c 12345).  The host has a data switch that  asks  "which  system";
the  script responds "myhost" (if the "which system" prompt doesn't appear, the
Telenet connect command is reissued).  The script waits for an "@" prompt  from
the  host,  then  sends  the user ID ("joe") and password ("secret"), looks for
another "@" prompt, runs Kermit, and in response to the Kermit's prompt  (which
ends  in  ">"),  gives  the commands "set parity even" and "server".  Files are
then exchanged.  The commands are in a take file; note the continuation of  the
'script' command onto several lines using the `\' terminator.

    set modem hayes
    set line /dev/acu
    set speed 1200
    set parity mark
    dial 9,5551212
    script ~0 ~0 ~0 ~0 ~0 ~0 ~0 ~0 @--@--@ id~saa001122 = 002211 @ \
        c~s12345 ystem-c~s12345-ystem myhost @ joe~ssecret @ kermit \
        > set~sparity~seven > server
    send some.stuff
    get some.otherstuff
    bye
    quit

Since  these  commands may be executed totally in the background, they can also
be scheduled.  A typical shell script, which might be scheduled by cron,  would
be as follows (csh used for this example):

    #
    #keep trying to dial and log onto remote host and exchange files
    #wait 10 minutes before retrying if dial or script fail.
    #
    cd someplace
    while ( 1 )
            kermit < /tonight.cmd >> nightly.log &
            if ( ! $status ) break
            sleep 600
    end

File  tonight.cmd  might  have two takes in it, for example, one to take a file
with the set modem, set line, set baud, dial, and script, and a second take  of
a  file  with  send/get  commands  for  the  remote  server.  The last lines of
tonight.cmd should be 'bye' and 'quit'.


                            THE 'TRANSMIT' COMMAND:

Syntax: transmit fn1 [c]

Send the given file without error checking, obeying current settings  for  file
type (text or binary), parity, and duplex.

In  text  mode, send the file a line at a time, using the character c as a line
turnaround character.  That is, send a line  from  the  file,  wait  until  the
character  c comes in response, then send the next line, etc.  Linefeed (10) is
the default turnaround character.  If zero (0) is specified for the  turnaround
character,  then  send  the  whole file without waiting for any response.  Each
line is terminated by a carriage return, just as you would type it  at  a  ter-
minal.  The UNIX linefeed is stripped.  The computer to which you are transmit-
ting the file should be prepared to  receive  it,  for  instance  into  a  text
editor.

In binary mode, send all the characters of the file with no modification and no
line turnaround handshake.  Use binary mode only if you know that the  computer
or device to which you are transmitting the file can receive arbitrary patterns
of characters at full speed.

The 'transmit' command cannot be interrupted.


                              THE 'HELP' COMMAND:

Syntax: help
   or: help keyword
   or: help {set, remote} keyword

Brief help messages or menus are always available at interactive command  level
by  typing  a question mark at any point.  A slightly more verbose form of help
is available through the 'help' command.  The 'help' command with no  arguments
prints  a  brief  summary of how to enter commands and how to get further help.
'help' may be followed by one of the top-level μCKermit command keywords,  such
as  'send', to request information about a command.  Commands such as 'set' and
'remote' have a further level of help.  Thus you may type 'help',  'help  set',
or  'help  set parity'; each will provide a successively more detailed level of
help.


                        THE 'EXIT' AND 'QUIT' COMMANDS:

These two commands are identical.  Both of them do the following:

   - Attempt to insure that the terminal is returned to normal.
   - Relinquish access to any communication line assigned via 'set line'.
   - Relinquish any uucp and multiuser locks on the communications line.
   - Hang up the modem, if the communications line supports data  terminal
     ready.
   - Close any open logs or other files.

After  exit  from μCKermit, your default directory will be the same as when you
started the program.  The 'exit' command is issued implicitly whenever μCKermit
halts normally, e.g. after a command line invocation, or after certain kinds of
interruptions.


1.5. UUCP Lock Files

UNIX has no standard way of obtaining exclusive  access  to  an  external  com-
munication  line.  When  you  issue  the 'set line' command  to  μCKermit, UNIX
would normally grant you access to the line  even  if  some  other  process  is
making  use  of  it.    The  method adopted by most UNIX systems to handle this
situation is the "UUCP lock  file".    UUCP,  the  UNIX-to-UNIX  Copy  program,
creates  a  file  in  its  directory  (usually /usr/spool/uucp, on some systems
/etc/locks) with a name like LCK..name, where name is the device name, for  in-
stance tty07.

μCKermit  uses UUCP  lock files in order to avoid conflicts  with UUCP, tip, or
other programs that follow this convention.  Whenever you attempt to access  an
external  line using the 'set line' command or `-l' on the command line, Kermit
looks in the UUCP directory for a lock file corresponding to that device.   For
instance, if you 'set line /dev/ttyS6' then Kermit looks for the file

    /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..ttyi6

If it finds this file, it gives you an error message and a directory listing of
the file so that you can see who is using it, e.g.

    -r--r--r--  1 fdc        8 Feb  7 13:02 /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..ttyi6

In this case, you would look up user fdc to find out how soon the line will be-
come free.

This  convention  requires  that  the  uucp  directory be publicly readable and
writable.  If it is not, the program will issue an appropriate warning message,
but will allow you to proceed at your own risk (and the risk of anyone else who
might also be using the same line).

If no lock file is found, μCKermit  will  attempt create  one, thus  preventing
anyone  who subsequently tries to run Kermit, UUCP, tip, or similar programs on
the same line from gaining access until you release the line.  If Kermit  could
not  create  the  lock  file (for instance because the uucp directory is write-
protected), then you will receive a warning message  but  will  be  allowed  to
proceed  at  your  -- and everyone else's -- risk.  When Kermit terminates nor-
mally, your lock file is removed.

Even when the lock directory is writable and readable,  the  locking  mechanism
depends  upon  all  users using the same name for the same device.  If a device
has more than one path associated with it, then a lock can be  circumvented  by
using an alias.

When a lock-creating program abruptly terminates, e.g. because it crashes or is
killed via shell  command,  the  lock  file  remains  in  the  uucp  directory,
spuriously  indicating  that  the line is in use.  If the lock file is owned by
yourself, you may remove it.  Otherwise, you'll have to get the  owner  or  the
system manager to remove it, or else wait for a system task to do so; uucp sup-
ports a function (uuclean) which removes these files after a predetermined  age
-- uucp sites tend to run this function periodically via crontab.

Locking  is  not needed, or used, if communications occur over the user's login
terminal line (normally /dev/tty).

It may be seen that line locking is fraught with peril.  It is included in UNIX
Kermit  only because other UNIX communication programs rely on it.  While it is
naturally desirable to assure exclusive access  to  a  line,  it  is  also  un-
desirable  to  refuse  access  to a vacant line only because of a spurious lock
file, or because the uucp directory is not appropriately protected.


1.6. File Attributes

New to version 4F of μCKermit is the transmission and acceptance  of  file  at-
tributes.  For UNIX, μCKermit sends the following attributes:

   - File size, in K.

   - Exact  file size, in bytes.  File sizes are based on the UNIX conven-
     tion for storing text files with a single LF terminating  each  line.
     If  a  UNIX  text file is sent to a different kind of system (e.g. an
     MS-DOS system, where text files are stored with CRLF at  the  end  of
     each line), the file may grow in size.

   - File creation date.

   - System identifier "U1" (UNIX).

   - File  type,  "B8"  for  binary  files,  or  "AMJ" for ASCII text with
     records terminated by Carriage Return (Ctrl-M) and Linefeed (Ctrl-J).

Sending the file size allows the receiving Kermit to do two useful things:  (1)
include "percent done" in its file transfer display, and (2) refuse the file in
case it is bigger than the available disk space.  If the receiving system  uses
the  file refusal  mechanism  in  response to μCKermit's attribute packet, UNIX
Kermit will not send the file.

When receiving files, μCKermit  reads  and  stores the file's attributes in  an
internal  structure.    These may be viewed in the debug log (see 'set debug').
In this release, all incoming attributes are ignored except File-Type and  Dis-
position.    The  file  type attribute does the equivalent of a "set file type"
command for the associated file, temporarily  overriding  the  prevailing  file
type.    If  the  Disposition  is "mail" (because the file was sent to μCKermit
using a MAIL command instead of a SEND command), then the file will  be  mailed
to  the specified user, instead of being stored on disk.  On BSD-based systems,
the mail will include the filename in the subject line; on  AT&T-based  systems
there  will  be no subject line.  If the Disposition is Print (because the user
gave a REMOTE PRINT command instead of a SEND command), then the file  will  be
printed, using any specified options.

If  the  exchange of attribute packets with the other Kermit program causes any
problems, then you may turn this feature off by issuing the  command  'set  at-
tributes off'.


1.7. μCKermit under Berkeley or System III/V UNIX:

μCKermit  may be interrupted at command level or during file transfer by typing
Control-C.  The program will perform its normal exit  function,  restoring  the
terminal and releasing any lock.  If a protocol transaction was in progress, an
error packet will be sent to the opposite  Kermit  so  that  it  can  terminate
cleanly.

μCKermit  may  be invoked in the background ("&" on shell commmand line).  If a
background process is "killed", the user will have to manually remove any  lock
file  and  may  need  to  restore  the  modem.  This is because the kill signal
(kill(x,9)) cannot be trapped by Kermit.

During execution of a system command ('directory', 'cwd', or `!'), μCKermit can
often  be returned to command level by typing a single Control-C.  (With System
III/V, the usual  interrupt  function  (often  the  DEL  key)  is  replaced  by
Control-C.)

Under  Berkeley  UNIX  only:  μCKermit may also be interrupted by ^Z to put the
process in the background.

Control-C, Control-Z, and Control-\ lose their normal functions during terminal
connection and also during file transfer when the controlling tty line is being
used for packet i/o.

If you are running μCKermit in "quiet mode" in the foreground, then  interrupt-
ing  the  program  with a console interrupt like Control-C will not restore the
terminal to normal conversational operation.  This is because the  system  call
to  enable console interrupt traps will cause the program to block if it's run-
ning in the background, and the primary reason for quiet mode is to  allow  the
program  to  run  in  the background without blocking, so that you can do other
work in the foreground.

If μCKermit is run in the background ("&" on shell commmand line), then the in-
terrupt  signal  (Control-C)  (and System III/V quit signal) are ignored.  This
prevents an interrupt signal intended for a foreground job (say a  compilation)
from being trapped by a background Kermit session.


1.8. μCKermit on the AT&T UNIX PC

For  UNIX  PC  owners  here  are a couple of hints.  The name of the phone line
devices are /dev/ph0 and /dev/ph1. The RS232 serial port is /dev/tty000.

Dialing out with the internal modem:

    uCKermit>set line /dev/ph0
    uCKermit>set speed 1200
    uCKermit>set modem att
    uCKermit>dial (123) 555-1212

Or use /dev/ph1 for the second  phone  line.    Control-C  will  terminate  the
dialer.  The telephone line must be in the DATA state; μCKermit will remind you
of this if it finds the line in VOICE state.

To connecting via the RS232C serial port, first you must  turn  off  the  login
processor  that  is  (or may be) associated with the port, then you can use the
port in the normal manner.

    $ /usr/bin/getoff.sh tty000
    $ kermit
    uCKermit>set line /dev/tty000
    uCKermit>set speed 9600
        (start doing work...)
        (after exiting μCKermit you may type:)
    $ /usr/bin/geton.sh tty000

You may omit the getoff/getoff lines if the line is not used for logging in.


1.9. μCKermit under VAX/VMS

μCKermit can be built using VAX-11 C to run under VMS.  Most  of  the  descrip-
tions  in this manual hold true, but it should be noted that as of this writing
the VMS support is not thoroughly tested, and no explicit  support  exists  for
the various types of VMS files and their attributes.


1.10. μCKermit on the Macintosh and other Systems

The  "protocol kernel" of μCKermit is also used by Columbia's Macintosh Kermit.
The user and system interface is  entirely  different,  and  is  covered  in  a
separate document.

There  is  also  a Kermit for the Commodore Amiga based on μCKermit, as well as
versions for MS-DOS, Data General operating systems, etc.


1.11. μCKermit Restrictions and Known Bugs

   1. Editing characters:  The program's  interactive  command  interrupt,
      delete,  and  kill  characters are Control-C, Delete (or Backspace),
      and Control-U, respectively.  There is currently no  way  to  change
      them  to  suit your taste or match those used by your shell, in case
      those are different.

   2. Flow control:  μCKermit attempts to use XON/XOFF flow control during
      protocol  operations,  but  it also puts the communication line into
      "rawmode".  On many systems, rawmode disables flow control, so  even
      though  you  may  have  "set flow xon/xoff", no flow control will be
      done.  This is highly system and UNIX-version dependent.

   3. Modem controls:  If a connection is made over a  communication  line
      (rather  than  on  the controlling terminal line), and that line has
      modem controls, (e.g. data  terminal  ready  and  carrier  detection
      implementation),  returning  to  the shell level will disconnect the
      conversation.  In that case, one should use  interactive  mode  com-
      mands,  and  avoid use of piped shell-level operation (also see 'set
      modem-dialer' and 'dial' commands.)

   4. Login Scripts:  The present login scripts implementation follows the
      UNIX conventions of uucp's "L.sys" file, rather than the normal Ker-
      mit "INPUT/OUTPUT" style.

   5. Dial-out vs dial-in  communications  lines:    μCKermit  requires  a
      dial-out or dedicated line for the "set line" or "-l" options.  Most
      systems have some lines dedicated  to  dial-in,  which  they  enable
      "loggers"  on,  and  some  lines  available  for  dial-out.   Recent
      releases of UNIX (ATT & Berkeley) have mechanisms for  changing  the
      directionality of a line.

   6. Using  μCKermit  on  Local Area Networks:  μCKermit can successfully
      operate at speeds up to 19200 baud over LANs, provided  the  network
      buffers are big enough to accommodate Kermit packets.

      When  computers  are connected to LANs through asynchronous terminal
      interfaces, then the connection should be configured to do  XON/XOFF
      flow  control between the network interface and the computer, rather
      than passing these signals through transparently.    This  can  help
      prevent  Kermit from overrunning the LAN's buffers if they are small
      (or if the LAN is congested), and will can also prevent the LAN from
      overrunning a slow Kermit's buffers.

      If  the network hardware cannot accept 100 characters at a time, and
      flow control cannot be done between the network  and  the  computer,
      then  Kermit's  "set send/receive packet-length" command can be used
      to shorten the packets.

   7. Resetting terminal after abnormal termination or kill: When μCKermit
      terminates abnormally (say, for example, by a kill command issued by
      the operator) the user may need to reset the  terminal  state.    If
      commands  do  not  seem  to  be  accepted  at  the shell prompt, try
      Control-J "stty sane" Control-J  (use  "reset"  on  Berkeley  UNIX).
      That  should  take  the  terminal  out of "raw mode" if it was stuck
      there.

   8. Remote host commands  may  time-out  on  lengthy  activity:    Using
      "remote  host"  to instruct the μCKermit server to invoke UNIX func-
      tions (like "make") that might take a long time  to  produce  output
      can cause timeout conditions.

   9. XOFF  deadlocks:    When  connecting back to μCKermit after a trans-
      action, or after finishing the server, it may be necessary to type a
      Control-Q  to  clear  up  an  XOFF  deadlock.   There's not much the
      program can do about this...

  10. Long time to exit:  It takes μCKermit several seconds to exit,  even
      on  a fast system.  This is because some time is necessary to ensure
      that restoration of the terminal line to its former  state  is  com-
      plete before closing it.

  11. Emergency  exit:    In interactive mode, the Ctrl-C Ctrl-C emergency
      exit terminates the program rather than going  back  to  the  inter-
      active prompt.

  12. Filename  syntax:  In interactive mode, fancy metacharacters and ex-
      pressions are not accepted in filenames within commands.
