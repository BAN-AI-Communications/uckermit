Xref: Apple Macintosh, See Macintosh

The new Macintosh Kermit, version 0.97(57), is ready for testing.

Included are all the ckm*.* sources, a .hqx file which can be converted into
the MacKermit application using BinHex Version 4, and two short doc files,
(ckmvt1.doc and ckmker.hlp).  All of this is built on top of C-Kermit 4F(080),
with my bug fixes in the ckc files (it even builds a wart to use).

I have personally tested it on a 512k (not e) running System 1.1, a Lisa
running MacWorks 3.0, Mac Pluses running System 2.0 through 6.0.3 and a Mac II
running 6.0.2; I am told it works on SE and SE30 machines also (which is not
really a supprise).  Basically the only thing it doesn't work on (for sure) is
an old 128k "Classic" Mac (if I had one here I could probably make it work
there too).

Anyone who is doing work on Mac Kermit should get a copy of the new sources as
soon as they can; I have changed some things around, especially the terminal
emulator internals.  Code based on 0.9(40) may or may not be easy to work into
the new sources.

New additions to the program since the 0.9(40) release in May 1988 include:

    Vertically sizeable terminal emulation window.
    Scroll back.
    Faster file transfer.
    (hopefully) Correct binary transfer code.
    MacBinary format transfers.
    Better keyboard handling.
    Partial emulation of a DEC VT300-Series terminal, including support
      for ISO 646 National Replacement Character sets, and Latin Alphabet 1.
	
More keyboard macros have been added to better handle the vt100 keyboard
and normal/application mode stuff:

	\keypad0 -- \keypad9
	\keypad,
	\keypad.
	\keypad-
	\pf1-4
	\leftarrow
	\rightarrow
	\uparrow
	\downarrow

The keypad comes configured for a Plus; if you have an ADB machine, you will
have to remap the + and - keys, and possibly =, /, and * to be pf2-4.

Bugs and limitations still outstanding:

    Running in inverted screen mode doesn't work.
    The option key is still a dead key for the usual characters (e, u, etc.)
    Parts of the Edit menu should be greyed out when they do not apply.
    Cut and Paste do not deal with the real Scrapbook (yet).
    There still isn't a Tektronix graphics terminal emulator built-in.
    It is possible to confuse the selection by draging past the top of
      the window, waiting, and dragging down past the end of the window.
	
Other than these, if you find a problem please send mail to
Info-Kermit@watsun.cc.columbia.edu (on the Internet), or KERMIT@CUVMA on
BITNET.  Please include Kermit version number, a discription of the hardware,
the System version number, and if possible a "repeat-by".

				Happy Kermiting,

[Ed. - Many thanks, Paul!  The new files have been placed in the kermit/test
directory on watsun and cunixc, and in the T: area of BITNET KERMSRV on CUVMA.
This release has to be considered a test release because it is based on a
test version of C-Kermit, and also because there is not yet a new manual.  Mac
Kermit users, please take a copy, try it out, and report bugs to Info-Kermit
as Paul asks.]

Subject: New Test Release of Mac Kermit
Keywords: Macintosh Kermit

New sources for Mac Kermit 0.98(62), compilable with the 4F(095) C-Kermit
files are now available, along with an up-to-date CKMKER.HQX file, which
can be decoded into the working Mac Kermit application using BinHex V4.

This version fixes the font assignment problems, makes mouse->arrow keys
work again, and does statistics on file transfer right.  It also is better
about keys when running under System 4.2 or better (specifically, it
disables dead-keys and doesn't strip off shifting when unmodifying keys).

                --Paul

[Ed. - Thanks Paul!  The new files have relaced the old ones in
kermit/test/ckm*.* on watsun, and in the T: area of BITNET KERMSRV on
CUVMA.  Please send reports and comments to Info-Kermit@watsun.]
